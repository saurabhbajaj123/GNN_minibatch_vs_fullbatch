# GNN_minibatch_vs_fullbatch
Compare training accuracies of full batch training with mini batch training

This repository contains all the code which was used for the Graph Neural Network Training Systems: **A Comparison of
Full-Graph and Mini-Batch. [Experiment, Analysis & Benchmark] paper.**

Here is the extended version of the report that was submitted to VLDB April 1st 2025
